# Vatu
Vatu Native a ANSI-C variant Compiler for 8086 16 bits.
The Language was simply designed to support the basics of the C langage and simplify it.
This project was based on Cosmos assembler (some classes of Vasm and BSN Gold Parser for c#).

The compiler simply converts a Vatu input to 16 bits Intel Assembly output (for NASM) ready to be
assembled.

####Vatu supports :
Namespaces,
Global, Local variables,
Register operations,
Assembly statements,
Flow Control Statements (return,goto,goto case,continue,next,break),
Iteration and Conditional Statements

####In The future : 
Fix a lot of bugs,
Return check,
Type check,
Standard library support,
More pointers and struct support,
Optimizer,
Compilation Interface,
Re-write (Clean code)
